Technical Story: https://wicmtdp.atlassian.net/browse/PRP-65

## Context and Problem Statement

How do we want to track significant technical decisions for this project?
How do we want to share research?

## Considered Options

* Tech specs
* ADRs
* Tech specs + ADRs

## Decision Outcome

* We'll use ADRs in this github repo to track significant technical or architectural decisions. See 0000-use-markdown-architectural-decisions.md for why ADRs.
* Any decisions that require significant research or discussion should first be documented as a tech spec in Confluence. Associated tech specs should be included as an attachment in `/docs/decisions/attachments/0006-<adr-name>-tech-spec.md`.
